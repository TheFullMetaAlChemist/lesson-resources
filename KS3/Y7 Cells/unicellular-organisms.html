    <h2 class="section-title">Section A – Basic Recall</h2>

    <div class="question">
        <p><strong>1.</strong> What is a unicellular organism?</p>
        <textarea></textarea>
        <details class="answer">
            <summary>Show answer</summary>
            <p>A unicellular organism is a living thing that is made of just one cell.</p>
        </details>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <p><strong>2.</strong> Name two places where amoebas can be found.</p>
        <textarea></textarea>
        <details class="answer">
            <summary>Show answer</summary>
            <p>Amoebas can be found in places such as fresh water, salt water, wet soil and even inside animals (any two of these).</p>
        </details>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <p><strong>3.</strong> What does the <em>nucleus</em> do in an amoeba?</p>
        <textarea></textarea>
        <details class="answer">
            <summary>Show answer</summary>
            <p>The nucleus controls the amoeba’s growth and reproduction and also controls the cell’s activities.</p>
        </details>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <p><strong>4.</strong> How does an amoeba move?</p>
        <textarea></textarea>
        <details class="answer">
            <summary>Show answer</summary>
            <p>An amoeba moves by changing the shape of its body, pushing part of the cell out in the direction it wants to go and letting the rest of the cell flow into it.</p>
        </details>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <p><strong>5.</strong> What is the function of the <em>food vacuole</em> in an amoeba?</p>
        <textarea></textarea>
        <details class="answer">
            <summary>Show answer</summary>
            <p>The food vacuole stores particles of food and digests them so the amoeba can use the nutrients.</p>
        </details>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <p><strong>6.</strong> Why does an amoeba need a <em>contractile vacuole</em>?</p>
        <textarea></textarea>
        <details class="answer">
            <summary>Show answer</summary>
            <p>The contractile vacuole removes excess water (and some waste) from the cell so that the amoeba does not swell up and burst.</p>
        </details>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <p><strong>7.</strong> What is the process called when an amoeba splits to form two new identical cells?</p>
        <textarea></textarea>
        <details class="answer">
            <summary>Show answer</summary>
            <p>The process is called <strong>binary fission</strong>.</p>
        </details>
    </div>

    <h2 class="section-title">Section B – Euglena Features</h2>

    <div class="question">
        <p><strong>8.</strong> Name the structure that helps a euglena detect light.</p>
        <textarea></textarea>
        <details class="answer">
            <summary>Show answer</summary>
            <p>The euglena has an <strong>eye spot</strong> that helps it detect light.</p>
        </details>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <p><strong>9.</strong> What is the role of the <em>chloroplasts</em> in a euglena?</p>
        <textarea></textarea>
        <details class="answer">
            <summary>Show answer</summary>
            <p>The chloroplasts absorb light energy so the euglena can carry out photosynthesis and make its own food.</p>
        </details>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <p><strong>10.</strong> What is the <em>flagellum</em> used for?</p>
        <textarea></textarea>
        <details class="answer">
            <summary>Show answer</summary>
            <p>The flagellum is a tail-like structure that beats like a propeller and helps the euglena swim through the water, often towards light.</p>
        </details>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <p><strong>11.</strong> Give one way in which a euglena is different from an amoeba.</p>
        <textarea></textarea>
        <details class="answer">
            <summary>Show answer</summary>
            <p>One difference is that a euglena has chloroplasts and can make its own food by photosynthesis, while an amoeba does not have chloroplasts and cannot photosynthesise.</p>
        </details>
    </div>

    <h2 class="section-title">Section C – Understanding &amp; Application</h2>

    <div class="question">
        <p><strong>12.</strong> Amoebas and euglenas are unicellular. Explain what this means using your own words.</p>
        <textarea></textarea>
        <details class="answer">
            <summary>Show answer</summary>
            <p>This means each organism is made of a single cell, and that one cell carries out all the life processes needed for the organism to survive.</p>
        </details>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <p><strong>13.</strong> A student says that a euglena is “like both a plant and an animal.” Using what you’ve read, explain why this claim could be partly true.</p>
        <textarea></textarea>
        <details class="answer">
            <summary>Show answer</summary>
            <p>The euglena is plant-like because it has chloroplasts and can photosynthesise to make its own food. It is also animal-like because it can move using a flagellum and can engulf and digest other organisms when there is not enough light.</p>
        </details>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <p><strong>14.</strong> Why is binary fission a useful method of reproduction for unicellular organisms?</p>
        <textarea></textarea>
        <details class="answer">
            <summary>Show answer</summary>
            <p>Binary fission is useful because it is a quick way to produce two identical daughter cells from one parent cell. The organism does not need a mate and can increase its numbers rapidly.</p>
        </details>
    </div>

    <h2 class="section-title">Section D – Challenge Questions</h2>

    <div class="question">
        <p><strong>15.</strong> Explain how the contractile vacuole helps prevent an amoeba or euglena from bursting.</p>
        <textarea></textarea>
        <details class="answer">
            <summary>Show answer</summary>
            <p>The contractile vacuole collects extra water inside the cell and then squeezes it out. This keeps the water level inside the cell balanced so the cell membrane does not stretch too much and burst.</p>
        </details>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <p><strong>16.</strong> How do the structures of a euglena help it to survive in water where light levels change?</p>
        <textarea></textarea>
        <details class="answer">
            <summary>Show answer</summary>
            <p>The eye spot helps the euglena sense where light is coming from, and the flagellum lets it swim towards brighter light so the chloroplasts can photosynthesise. If there is not enough light, the euglena can feed by surrounding and digesting other small organisms.</p>
        </details>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <p><strong>17.</strong> If a euglena cannot make enough food by photosynthesis, what does it do to survive? Why is this useful?</p>
        <textarea></textarea>
        <details class="answer">
            <summary>Show answer</summary>
            <p>When it cannot make enough food by photosynthesis, a euglena feeds like an animal by surrounding and engulfing bacteria or algae and digesting them. This is useful because it allows the euglena to survive even when light levels are low.</p>
