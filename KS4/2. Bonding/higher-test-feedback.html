            a: "Molten salt is (l) because it is a pure substance in the liquid phase. Salt in water is (aq) because the ions have been pulled apart by water molecules to form a solution. Both allow ions to move, but the process of reaching that state (melting vs dissolving) is different."

            q: "<strong>Refining Models:</strong> Why do scientists still use the particle model if it has so many limitations?",
